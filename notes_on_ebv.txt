The two main uncertainties in the Mni (logbol) calculations are the reddening and the distance measurement. 

In this note, we focus on the reddening issues (the distances have uncertainties propagated from the redshift and are consistent with the measurements in the literature)
Note: Above is true for objects anaylsed with distance measures in the literature (thus, none exist for CSP2)

There are  a few objects with significantly different reddening estimates from Bruns '11, Burns '14, Kattner '12 and SNPy fits to light curves. 


SN2008ia has significant galactic reddening which needs to be corrected for
SN2006gt has a factor of 4 difference in the EBVhost between Kattner 2012 and Burns 2014
SN2004gs has a higher host extinction than 0.1 and should be removed from sample
