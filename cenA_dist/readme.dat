Bruno's idea to use the absolute magnitude measurements for the highly reddened 5 (esp. 86G given its proximity) to measure a distance to the host. 

Formula:

m_B(obs)=M_B(abs)+mu+A_V
=>
m_B-M_B-A_V=mu

m_B---> from LC fit 
A_V---> NaID lines (? see Phillips et al. [1987])
M_B ---> t2-Mni relation, gives bolometric peak and B-peak
