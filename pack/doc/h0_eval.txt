H0 evaluated using Type Ia supernovae with Cepheid calibrated distances

log H0= 0.2*(M_V+alpha)

Monte Carlo simulations for errors

---> Idea is to skip the cepheid distance calibration in order to remove a large component of the systematics in the error budget

---> MJ from Stephane's models
	. zero point from Folatelli+
